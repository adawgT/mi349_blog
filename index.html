Showa Era (1975-1989) The Showa Era began with “Himitsu Sentai Gorenger” and continued until “Kousoku Sentai Turboranger.” This era introduced the classic elements we love: teams of heroes in bright, color-coded suits, powerful transformation sequences, and massive robots, or mecha, battling gigantic monsters. It set the foundation for everything that followed, with a fun and pioneering spirit. Heisei Era (1989-2019) The Heisei Era took Super Sentai to new heights, from “Chikyuu Sentai Fiveman” to “Kishiryu Sentai Ryusoulger.” This period brought deeper stories, more developed characters, and impressive special effects. It was also during this time that Super Sentai reached global audiences through its adaptation into “Power Rangers,” making it a worldwide phenomenon. Reiwa Era (2019-Present) Now, we’re in the Reiwa Era, which began with “Mashin Sentai Kiramager.” This era uses the latest technology for stunning visual effects and introduces fresh, creative stories. The Reiwa Era continues to push the boundaries, keeping the spirit of Super Sentai alive and exciting for new generations. Each era of Super Sentai has its unique charm, reflecting the growth of this timeless franchise.
