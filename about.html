            <img src="images/author.jpg" alt="Picture of the author">
            <p>Hello! Im Aaron Nguyen, a 20-something college student pursuing a degree in Information Science at MSU. My journey in tech started with a childhood fascination for how things work, which naturally evolved into a passion for coding and problem-solving.

                At MSU, I’m actively involved in various student organizations, including the VSA and other asian american clubs. These experiences have not only sharpened my technical skills but also fostered a love for teamwork and leadership.
                
                Beyond the classroom, I’m an enthusiastic learner, always curious about new technologies and how they can shape our future. I’ve taken on several projects, from developing mobile apps to contributing to open-source software, which have given me hands-on experience and a deeper understanding of the tech world.
                
                In my free time, you can find me exploring, lifting weights or watching shows and movies. 
                
                I believe in the power of technology to create positive change and am eager to make my mark in the tech industry. I’m always open to connecting with like-minded individuals and exploring new opportunities, so feel free to reach out! </p>
